# astar
Totally not me studying and implementing the astar algorithm in under 2 hours to flex on a certain somebody :)

# How To Use:
1. Just fork func.py and import it into your project as seen in main.py
2. Use the astar function: astar(map_, numMap, start, end) which returns the shortest path to end


- map_ is a 2d array of nodes and numMap is a 2d array of numbers 0 and 1 where 1 is an unwalkable path
- start and end are both tuples, stating the position of the start and end points
- start is by default (0, 0) and end is by default (-1, -1) which is located at the bottom right of the map
